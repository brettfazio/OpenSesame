## Vision Statement
OpenSesame is an application marketed towards students, staff, and maintenance personnel to report & publicly display property damages across UCFâ€™s campus.  Features of the application include, but are not limited to, priority elevation of frequently reported issues, a user-driven, live updating map of potential property issues, and a listing of all reported issues for UCF maintenance personnel to manage accordingly.  

OpenSesame is a property management application that enables students to self-report issues that may require work orders, and display them on a top-down geographical map, accessible from anywhere on campus via a mobile app. Separating it from leading products, our app focuses on user-driven reports to maintain up-to-date reports on property damage, undersupplied restrooms, as well as giving students an easy and convenient method to report issues on campus property.

- For... people on the main campus of UCF.
- Who/That... use the physical facilities and services on campus.
- The product... an Android app that allows users to mark geographic locations on campus of physical accessibility or maintenance issues.
- That leads to... people being able to better navigate the main campus of UCF more safely and more efficiently.
- Unlike the... current suite of UCF applications which provide a low level of detail about present situations.
- Our product offers... a live or recently updated map that is accessible to anyone on campus.

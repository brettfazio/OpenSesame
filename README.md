## Description

## Vision Statement

- For... people on the main campus of UCF.
- Who/That... use the physical facilities and services on campus.
- The product... an Android app that allows users to mark geographic locations on campus of physical accessibility or maintenance issues.
- That leads to... people being able to better navigate the main campus of UCF more safely and more efficiently.
- Unlike the... current suite of UCF applications which provide a low level of detail about present situations.
- Our product offers... a live or recently updated map that is accessible to anyone on campus.

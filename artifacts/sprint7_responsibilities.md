**Jordan:**

**Brett (brettfazio):** Code for fetching markers from the backend, displaying them on the map, and logic for transitioning on marker press (and added tests). Added requirements to requirements document. Added tests for report UID. Added functionality to see if map is centered on UCF, if it is added ability to easily file a work order form. Removed that button if focusing on something outside of UCF, added tests for that. Did the Sprint 7 Demo.

**Danny:** Updating and fixing ReferenceMarkers to add new UID field to mark a many-to-one relationship between users and their markers to display on the Account page. Updated Account page so that it populates with user's markers correctly with correct layout of user boxes vs. the List view.
